# Demo Doc

This is a doc to demonstrate different syntax and options available in the
documentation pages.

## Frontmatter

Doc pages require frontmatter, which is written at the top of the file in YAML
format. The two properties that matter are `title` and `order`, which is used to
determine what order the pages appear in.

## MDX React Component Import

If your doc uses the `.mdx` extension, you can import React components from
elsewhere in the app and run it here. For example, here is a Thorium button:

<Button onClick={() => alert("Hi there!")}>Hi there!</Button>

> Note that you can't use fancy `@thorium/ui` paths here, since the MDX import
> doesn't recognize them. You have to use a full relative path to the component.

## Images

Images can be referenced using a relative path, like this:

![Thorium Logo](../../images/logo.svg)
