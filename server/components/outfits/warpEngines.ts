/**
 * Factors in warp drive use
 * - All warp drives are limited by the gravity in solar systems, so they automatically go slower.
 * - All warp drives go the same speed at the same warp factor, and all ships are capable of going
 *   the same warp factors;
 * - Cruising speed (warp 5) is 5.996Ã—10^11 km/s, or 2000000c. This enables travel from one end of
 *   the known universe to the other in about 8 hours, and provides reasonable speeds for local
 *   interstellar travel (2.6 minutes to travel 10 ly, 10.5 minutes to travel 40 ly)
 * - Cruising speed in a solar system (still warp 5) is 2.998*10^7 km/s or 100c. This allows travel from
 *   the sun to Neptune (the outer edges of the solar system) in 2.5 minutes.
 * - Warp 1 is 1/100 cruising speed. All of the warp factors between grow linearly from there.
 * - Traveling for long periods of time (> 7 minutes) at cruising speed should be uncomfortable from a
 *   heat/coolant and fuel perspective.
 * - One step above cruising speed is emergency warp, and a final "destructive warp" after that.
 * - Energy consumption and heat levels increase exponentially. This is to
 *   discourage going at high speeds for long time periods. Higher speeds should only be used for
 *   intercept courses and catching up with other ships.
 * - Conversely, going at lower speeds would have virtually no energy consumption (outside of the surge
 *   needed for the initial jump) and produce little heat, but would take a very long time to get anywhere.
 * - To jump to warp speed in any circumstance, the warp engines have to be "spooled". A
 *   Compensated Pulsed Dynamo, or just "Dynamo", charges up a massive flywheel which is then engaged
 *   when the ship is to jump to warp. To charge up enough energy to jump to Warp 1 should take at least 30
 *   seconds (although play testing can clear up how long it really should be).
 * - After the engine is spooled to Warp 1, or if the ship is already traveling at warp speed, subsequent
 *   spooling should only take 5 seconds per warp speed
 * - Warp Engines can only be activated if the ship is at full stop. Spooling can happen at any time.
 * - Spooling the engines creates more heat than having the engines active to discourage keeping the engines
 *   spooled all the time. Spool heat decreases slowly when the engines are deactivated.
